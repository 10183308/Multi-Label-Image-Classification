# Multi-Label-Image-Classification
The objective of this study is to develop a deep learning model that will identify the natural scenes from images.

# Dataset
The image data set consists of 2,000 natural scene images, where a set of labels is artificially assigned to each image. The link(http://lamda.nju.edu.cn/data_MIMLimage.ashx) gives the detailed description of the number of images associated with different label sets, where all the possible class labels are desert, mountains, water, sunset and trees. The number of images belonging to more than one class (e.g. sea+sunset) comprises over 22% of the data set, many combined classes (e.g. mountains+sunset +trees) are extremely rare. On average, each image is associated with 1.24 class labels.
